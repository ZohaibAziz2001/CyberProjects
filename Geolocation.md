# Geolocation Data Extraction for RDP Brute Force Attacks

## Overview
This project enhances Azure’s ability to detect and mitigate Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute force attacks by automating geolocation data extraction, allowing for more effective threat identification and response. By leveraging PowerShell scripts, the project automates the analysis of Windows Event Viewer logs, facilitating real-time insights into attack patterns and geographic origins, ultimately improving incident response strategies and bolstering overall cloud security.

## Features
- Automated Geolocation Data Extraction: Extracts and parses geolocation data from Windows Event Viewer logs to identify and track suspicious RDP login attempts.
  
- Real-time Attack Visualization: Utilizes Azure’s geolocation services to visualize the geographic origins of detected attacks, enabling security teams to assess threats more effectively.
  
- Enhanced Threat Detection: Integrates alerts for suspicious RDP activity, helping to proactively identify and respond to potential brute force attacks before they escalate.
  
- Comprehensive Reporting: Generates detailed reports on RDP login attempts, including geographic data and timestamps, facilitating in-depth analysis and reporting for compliance and security audits.
  
- PowerShell Automation: Utilizes PowerShell scripting to streamline the detection process, ensuring efficiency and reducing the potential for human error in threat identification.
