# SOC Lab Development and Honeypot Project

## Overview
This ongoing project involves creating a multi-OS Security Operations Center (SOC) lab designed for advanced threat simulation, incident response training, and cybersecurity research. By integrating a variety of systems and tools, including a configured pfSense firewall and secured machines, this lab provides a robust environment for analyzing and responding to real-world cyber threats. The setup facilitates comprehensive vulnerability assessments using Nessus and enables the collection of critical data through Splunk forwarding from a dedicated honeypot, fostering an immersive learning experience in threat detection and mitigation strategies.

## Features
- Multi-OS Lab Architecture: Architected a versatile lab environment supporting both Linux and Windows systems, enabling the simulation of diverse attack scenarios and defense strategies.
  
- Honeypot Integration: Integrated a honeypot into Splunk to actively monitor and analyze malicious traffic, capturing attacker behavior and providing valuable insights for incident response training.
  
- Configured pfSense Firewall: Set up a pfSense firewall to secure network traffic within the lab, implementing robust security rules to control access and mitigate potential threats.
  
- Vulnerability Assessments via Nessus: Conducted regular vulnerability assessments using Nessus to identify and remediate security weaknesses, enhancing the overall security posture of the lab environment.

- Data-Driven Threat Analysis: Utilized Splunk forwarding from the honeypot to collect and analyze attack data, facilitating real-time visibility into security incidents and improving response capabilities.
