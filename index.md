# Welcome To My Cybersecurity Project's GitHub!

This is where I will post all my completed and in-progress projects.

# Project: Geolocation Data Extraction for RDP Brute Force Attacks in Azure `(March 2024 - Present)`

_For this project, I developed a PowerShell-based solution to enhance Azureâ€™s ability to detect and mitigate Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute force attacks._  
**Key Features:**
- Developed scripts to parse and extract geolocation data from Windows Event Viewer logs.
- Automated the detection of suspicious RDP login attempts.
- Integrated real-time geolocation APIs to map the origins of attacks visually, improving incident response.

> This project demonstrates expertise in automation, Azure cloud security, and leveraging PowerShell for threat detection.

# Project: Security Operations Center (SOC) Lab Development and HoneyPot Project `(January 2024 - Present)`

_This ongoing project involves designing a versatile Security Operations Center (SOC) lab environment for advanced threat simulation and incident response._  
**Key Features:**
- Architected a multi-OS SOC lab with Linux and Windows systems to simulate real-world cyberattacks.
- Integrated a honeypot into Splunk via a universal forwarder to capture and analyze attacker behavior.
- Gained valuable insights into malicious network traffic, aiding in incident response training.

> This project highlights my ability to develop complex lab environments for cybersecurity training and data-driven threat analysis.

# Project: Phishing Analysis `(November 2023)`

_A phishing analysis project focused on enhancing organizational resilience against phishing attacks._  
**Key Features:**
- Analyzed over 100 phishing emails within a secure virtual environment.
- Classified phishing attempts based on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- Developed and implemented a phishing awareness system that resulted in a 75% reduction in successful phishing attempts.

> This project showcases my expertise in email security, phishing detection, and security awareness training.
