# Advanced Phishing Threat Analysis and Mitigation Strategy

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing phishing threats to improve detection, reduce attack success rates, and strengthen organizational security.

## Features
- Phishing Email Classification: Analyzed over 100 phishing emails by examining the content, headers, and URLs to classify them based on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), utilizing frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK.

- Risk Assessment & Prioritization: Developed a structured process to assess the risk associated with each phishing email, categorizing threats by severity, potential impact, and likelihood of success, helping prioritize the organization's response.

- Phishing Awareness Training: Designed and implemented a phishing awareness program that significantly reduced the organization's susceptibility to phishing attacks, leading to a 75% reduction in successful phishing attempts.

- Automated Threat Detection: Leveraged email filtering tools and custom rules to automate the detection and flagging of potentially malicious emails, enhancing incident response times and reducing manual analysis.

- Incident Reporting & Documentation: Created comprehensive incident reports for each phishing attempt, documenting attack vectors, potential risks, and remediation steps. These reports were used to update policies and improve security postures.
